Documentation

Hi all - I've recently reached the end of my roughly six month journey getting my homelab setup and along the way I've reinstalled Proxmox more times than I care to admit. 
The reason for this repo's existence is to document my standard practices, default packages and preferred configuration. I am aware things like Ansible exist and I do plan on 
adding that eventually. As it stands that's ideally who this document would be for, it's presented as a sectioned copypasta. This idea of keeping this simple will allow anyone 
else the same opportunity to use this work to expand into their own scripts if they so desire.

Objectives:

  - Expand the scope of function beyond what is already available VIA Proxmox Helper Scripts

- https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/scripts
  - https://github.com/community-scripts/ProxmoxVE

  - Reliable access to one-shot install clips and key third party package repositories. I almost made this number one because I really feel anyone that is serious about
    Proxmox or overall virtualization concepts.. well you'll definitely want a cookbook. This is absolutely essential otherwise you WILL lose your mind trying to remember
    all of the commands, packages and quirks to getting it all working together..
