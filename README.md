<h3>Haphazardly collected scripts & tricks I've refined while building my homelab.</h2>

<h2>Objectives:</h3>

  <p>Expand the scope of beyond what is available VIA Proxmox Helper Scripts

  <https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/scripts>
  <https://github.com/community-scripts/ProxmoxVE>

  Reliable access to one-shot install clips and key third party package
  repositories. I almost titled this you WILL lose your mind trying to remember
  all of the commands, concepts and lopsided code philosophy's so document it
  instead! The idea is to waste less time doing tedious configurations so
  instead you can spend that time on building up something unique. </p>
