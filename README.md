<h2>Haphazardly collected scripts & tricks I've refined while building my homelab.</h2>

Objectives:

  Expand the scope of beyond what is available VIA Proxmox Helper Scripts

  <https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/scripts>
  <https://github.com/community-scripts/ProxmoxVE>

  Reliable access to one-shot install clips and key third party package repositories. I almost made this number one because I really feel anyone that is serious about
  Proxmox or overall virtualization concepts.. well you'll definitely want a cookbook. This is absolutely essential otherwise you WILL lose your mind trying to remember
  all of the commands, packages and quirks to getting it all working together..
