## 🧠 Contribution Rules ##

1. **Every tip must be actionable**  
   Include a command, config snippet, GUI path, or a technical explanation tied to:
   - Performance
   - Reliability
   - Auditability
   - Onboarding clarity

2. **Tag the risk level**  
   Use emoji splash blocks like:
   - `🔒 Safe`
   - `⚠️ Experimental`
   - `🧪 Edge`

3. **Include node context if relevant**  
   If your tip applies to Selene, Pandorum, or Nyx, say so explicitly.

4. **Explain the why**  
   Don’t just say what to do — explain why it matters.

5. **Avoid vague advice or tip drift**  
   If it’s outdated, mark it. If it’s spicy, splash-block it.

6. **Keep it loud, branded, and contributor-savvy**  
   This repo is designed for future operators — make your tip memorable and regret-proof.
